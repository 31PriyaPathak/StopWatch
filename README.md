# StopWatch
I have made a stopwatch using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. 
It basically has 3 buttons (start,  pause and stop).
With just a single click at start it starts.
A person can pause it and restart it from the same timings.
the timer can be reset to 0 as well.
Basically using stopwatch can help a person manage his/her timings more effeciently and for productive results.
